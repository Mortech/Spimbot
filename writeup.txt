Our strategy is to go about grabbing our tokens in a set order, starting at the center. We do this so that our bot and head to the center of the map before any scans have completed, meaning we will be ready to start collecting as soon as we are done scanning. We also use separate data chunks for each scan, so that we can start the next scan before processing data from the first scan. Once we have the points, our driving system uses two steps to ensure that we will always pick up any tokens we go after.

Using 9 scan areas, we can make sure to hit tokens without having to spend as much time as it would on a full-map scan. Because scanning still takes a while to complete, we don't bother sorting our tokens; the bot won't take the most efficient path, but still finishes at about the same time as the next scan. We have fine-tuned the scan area so that we don't miss too many tokens, but still finish in a decent amount of time. After scanning all 9 areas, we then do a final scan to make sure that we have collected every token.
